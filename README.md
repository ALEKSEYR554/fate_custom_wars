# 1. Pre-game Setup

It is recommended to create a new folder for the game and place the .exe file and all related folders inside it.

- The **"Servant"** folder contains all servant data.
- The **"Command spell"** folder contains all available command spells.

# 2. How to Start a Session

This is a multiplayer game, so you need at least one other player. For testing purposes, you can run two instances of the game simultaneously and press the debug switch in the bottom-right corner.

You will need to connect via IP, so a LAN emulator (e.g., Hamachi, Radmin VPN) or a real VPN is required.

**For the Host (Player 1):**
1.  Press the **"HOST"** button.
2.  Press **"Host"** again to create the server.
3.  Wait for the other player to connect. When the connection is successful, you will see all "Data Lost" images change to "Data Found".
4.  Once everyone is connected, press the **"Start"** button.

**For the Client (Player 2,3,..):**

1.  Press the **"CONNECT"** button.
2.  Enter the Host's IP address and the PORT number that appeared on the Host's screen.

**Servant Selection:**

1.  The servant selection screen will appear. Every player must choose their servant.
2.  After everyone has chosen, the Host has two options:
    -   Press **"Start"** to generate the game field and immediately begin the game.
    -   Press **"Restart Field"** to generate a new field without starting. You can then press **"Start"** to begin the game on that field.
